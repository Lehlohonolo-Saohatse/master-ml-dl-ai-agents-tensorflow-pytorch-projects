This repository contains my Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, datasets, visualizations, and mini-projects completed while taking the **AI Engineer Associate Certificate Course**.  
It serves as both a personal learning record and a public portfolio showcasing practical skills in:

- Advanced **Feature Engineering** & Model Evaluation
- **Classical ML** (Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Ensembles)
- **Deep Learning** fundamentals and from-scratch implementations
- Production-grade model building with **TensorFlow / Keras** and **PyTorch**
- Introduction to **AI Agents** concepts and applications
