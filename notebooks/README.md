# Notebooks – AI Engineer Associate Certificate Course

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks created while following the **AI Engineer Associate Certificate Course** (School of AI / AI Academy).

Notebooks are organized by course day, section, or project. Each subfolder includes:
- The main `.ipynb` file(s)
- A project-specific `README.md` with key observations, screenshots, and learnings
- An `images/` folder for plots, data summaries, etc.

We update this index as new work is added.
